Based on the CV provided, here are some potential reasons why you may not be getting interviews:

Lack of focus: The work experiences listed in the CV span different domains - backend engineering, web development, data analysis, and more. While it's great to have diverse skills, the lack of focus may make it difficult for hiring managers to understand your career goals and what you're really good at. Consider tailoring your CV to highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job you're applying for.

Lack of quantifiable achievements: While the work experiences listed are impressive, they lack quantifiable achievements or impact. Consider adding specific metrics or results to showcase the impact you made in your previous roles. For example, did you increase efficiency, reduce costs, or improve user experience?

Limited project experience: While the listed projects are interesting, they seem to be mostly academic or personal projects. Consider adding more projects that are relevant to the job you're applying for, and highlight the skills and tools you used to complete those projects.

Limited soft skills: While technical skills are important, soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are also highly valued by employers. Consider adding examples of how you demonstrated these skills in your previous roles or projects.

Lack of personalization: The CV seems to be quite generic and does not necessarily reflect your personality or interests. Consider adding a brief summary or objective statement that highlights your personal goals and career aspirations, and how they align with the company and job you're applying for.

Overall, the key to a strong CV is to showcase your relevant skills and experiences in a clear and concise manner, while also highlighting your personal goals and values. Good luck with your job search!


can you give me samples on the points above?

Sure, here are some examples of how you could improve your CV based on the points mentioned:

Lack of focus:
Example: If you're applying for a backend engineering role, you could tailor your CV to highlight your experience in that area. For instance, you could move the work experience at Risksis Technology Limited to the bottom of the list since it's not as relevant to the job you're applying for. You could also add more details about your work experience at IBM Hong Kong that showcase your backend engineering skills, such as:

Developed and maintained microservices for a multinational bank in Singapore using Java Spring Boot.
Optimized API performance by implementing caching and reducing network latency.
Collaborated with front-end developers to ensure seamless integration of back-end services.
Lack of quantifiable achievements:
Example: In your work experience section, you could add metrics or results to showcase the impact you made in your previous roles. For instance:

Increased test coverage by 50% through the implementation of automated BBT tests using the Karate Framework.
Reduced data collection time by 30% by implementing a new process to categorize companies by industry for the data pipeline.
Improved user engagement by 20% through the development of a Google Sheets-like UI for user interaction with raw data.

Demonstrated strong communication skills by presenting technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Showcased strong teamwork skills by collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products.
Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by identifying and resolving complex technical issues in a timely manner.
Lack of personalization:
Example: You could add a brief summary or objective statement that highlights your personal goals and career aspirations. For instance:

Objective: To leverage my backend engineering skills to develop scalable and reliable systems that improve user experience.
Summary: Experienced Java developer with a passion for solving complex problems and delivering high-quality products. Seeking a challenging role that allows me to utilize my technical skills and collaborate with cross-functional teams.
Remember, these are just examples, and you should tailor your CV to your unique skills and experiences. Good luck with your job search!
